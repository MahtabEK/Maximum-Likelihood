# Maximum-Likelihood
The poisson distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution is a discrete probability distribution often used to describe count-based data, like how many snowflakes fall in a day.  If we have count data  𝑦  that are influenced by a covariate or feature  𝑥 , we can used the maximum likelihood principle to develop a regression model relating  𝑥  to  𝑦 .
